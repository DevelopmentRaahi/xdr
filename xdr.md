Frequently Asked Questions: [H2]
1. What is XDR (X-Directional Reduction)?([h3])

XDR (Extended Detection & Response) is a cybersecurity tool that provides unified threat detection across multiple layers of security, including email, endpoints and networks. It integrates data sources to provide security teams with a holistic view and enable faster, more accurate response.

2. What is the difference between XDR and EDR?([h3])
While Endpoint Detection and Response focuses on endpoint-related threats only, XDR extends its coverage to multiple domains such as email, cloud systems, and networks. XDR provides a broader range of visibility and correlation in order to combat complex, multi-vectored attacks.

3. Why is XDR so important to cybersecurity?([h3])
XDR responds to the challenges posed by sophisticated cyberattacks today by:
●	Provides comprehensive visibility of threats across multiple environments.
●	Reduce response time by combining data from different layers.
●	Consolidating data and tools into a single platform simplifies threat management.

4. What is XDR?([h3])
XDR aggregates data from different security tools such as email security, firewalls, EDR and SIEM. It identifies anomalies using artificial intelligence and advanced analytics. These insights enable security teams to quickly detect, investigate and remediate threats.

5. What are the main advantages of XDR?([h3])
The following are some of the key benefits:
●	Data collection from multiple security products unified to improve threat visibility
●	Reduced investigation time through correlation and prioritization.
●	Filtering and prioritization reduce false positives.
●	Consolidated security tools reduce the cost of multiple tools.

6. Who should use XDR?([h3])
XDR is a great tool for organizations of any size, but especially those with hybrid environments, complex IT infrastructures or limited security resources. XDR is perfect for companies that want to improve their incident response and threat detection capabilities without increasing costs or complexity.
